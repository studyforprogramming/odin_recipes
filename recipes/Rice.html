  <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>
  <img src="../images/rice.jpg">
  <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africaâ€™s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered</li>
    <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1  tablespoon finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (about 2 peppers)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>4 lbs boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt/li>
    <li>1/4 small red onion, cut into 1/8-inch thick wedges</li> 
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water.</li>
    <li>Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
  </ol>
